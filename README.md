## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS media queries
- CSS calculattions
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a bit easy to edit but it taught me how to use media queries more effectively.
To mantain the beauty of the interface, I had to use more than one breakpoints and let it 
respond to different screen sizes.


### Continued development

In this project I faced challenges with CDN hosted fonts. The font weights were not working. So I resorted to downloading 
the fonts and included them locally. This method worked and I was able to include the fonts. But
locally hosting the fonts reduces page load speeds. For this reason I will try to see why the font-weight 
property was not working for the fonts hosted online. Am sure in the future projects I will try to include
the ones hosted on the CDN.
